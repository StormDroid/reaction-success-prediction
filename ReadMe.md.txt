## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

- Load and explore reaction data
- Handle missing or non-numeric values
- Visualize feature distributions with histograms
- Scale features with StandardScaler
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train and evaluate:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - XGBoost Classifier
- Plot confusion matrices for model evaluation

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset `reaction_data.csv` contains:
- **Temperature** (Â°C)
- **pH** (acidity/basicity)
- **Concentration** (mol/L)
- **Pressure** (atm)
- **Catalyst** (binary 0 or 1)
- **Reaction_Success** (target: 1 = success, 0 = failure)

## âœ… Project Results

| Model                | Accuracy  |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 100%      |
| SVC                  | 100%      |
| XGBoost              | 100%      |

> *Note: Due to small dataset size (10 samples), models perform perfectly. With larger datasets, additional tuning would be needed.*

## ðŸŒ± Future Improvements

- Add more reaction data for better model generalization
- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy the best model using Flask or FastAPI
- Build a small web app to predict reaction outcomes
